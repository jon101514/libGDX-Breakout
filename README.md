# libGDX-Breakout
 Rudimentary libGDX game to learn the technology.
 
 This version of Breakout uses only 45-degree angles for its ball movement, and was created to quickly learn and adapt to libGDX.

This project would have not been possible without:
Kevin Glass (CokeAndCode)'s Space Invaders for Java tutorial (http://www.cokeandcode.com/info/tut2d.html)
libGDX "Drop" official tutorial (https://libgdx.com/dev/simple-game/)
